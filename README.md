# rationalNumber
A program with a RationalNumber class. In mathematics, a rational number is a number that can be represented as a fraction, where both the numerator and the denominator in the fraction are integers (i.e., whole numbers).
This class has the following capabilties:
a. A constructor that receives two integer parameters (the first is the numerator, and the second is the denominator) that prevents a 0 denominator in a fraction, reduces or simplifies fractions that are not in reduced form and avoids negative denominators.
b. A printRational member function that prints out a RationalNumber object.
c. Overload the addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/) operators, and assignment (=) operators.
d. Overload the relational and equality (<, >, <=, >=, ==, and !=) operators.
